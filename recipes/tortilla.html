        <img src="../images/tortilla.jpg" alt="Tortilla">

        <p>Thin, circular unleavened flatbread from Mexico and Central America originally made from maize hominy meal, and now also from wheat flour.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
           
            <ul>
                <li>250g plain flour, plus a little more for dusting</li>
                <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>Â½ tsp fine salt</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Combine the flour, vegetable oil and salt in a bowl. Pour over 150ml warm water and knead to bring the mixture together. Remove from the bowl and knead on a lightly floured work surface for around 5 mins until you make a soft, smooth ball of dough. Cover with a clean tea towel and rest for at least 15 mins before rolling out.</li>
                <li>Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces (about 75g each). Roll out each ball of dough as thinly as possible on a floured work surface. They should make rounds about 20 cm wide, 2mm thick.</li>
                <li>Heat a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Cook the tortillas for 1-2 mins on each side until golden brown and toasted. Wrap them in foil and cover in a tea towel to keep warm, while you cook the rest. Keeps for two days well wrapped, or cool, wrap and freeze for up to three months.</li>
            </ol>
